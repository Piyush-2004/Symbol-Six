# Symbol Six

## Overview
Symbol Six is an interactive web-based dice-rolling game where players roll six virtual 3D dice, each featuring the logos of six prominent 
companies: BDO, Deloitte, Grant Thornton, EY, KPMG, and PwC. The game showcases a visually appealing UI with a gradient background, animated dice rolls, 
and a results display that shows which logo each die lands on. The project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on creating a fun and engaging experience.

## Features
- **Six 3D Dice**: Each die has six faces, with each face displaying a unique company logo (BDO, Deloitte, Grant Thornton, EY, KPMG, PwC).
- **Rolling Animation**: A smooth 3D rolling animation for each die, triggered by clicking the "Roll the dice" button.
- **Unique Logo per Die**: Each roll ensures that all six dice display different logos, avoiding duplicates.
- **Results Display**: After each roll, the results are shown below the dice (e.g., "Die 1: BDO | Die 2: EY | ...").
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts for different screen sizes, switching from a 3x2 grid to 2x3 or 1x6 on smaller screens.
- **Modern UI**: Features a gradient background, Poppins font, and a stylish button with hover effects.
